I am a first-year Ph.D. candidate at the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), advised by Prof. [Kai Xu](https://kevinkaixu.net/index.html). Prior to this, I graduated from the Future Technology Institute at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT). My research interests lie at the intersection of embodied intelligence and defect detection, focusing on developing adaptive systems that perceive, reason, and interact with complex environments.
